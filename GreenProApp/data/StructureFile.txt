The file name should be:
"GeneralTags.txt" if you want to add general tags
"ArtistTags.txt" if you want to add artist tags
"QuestionMarkTags.txt" ....
"CopyrightTags.txt" if you want to add copyright tags
"CharacterTags.txt" if you want to add character tags
"MetaTags.txt" if you want to add meta tags

There should only be the tags inside the file, all of them separated by spaces (you have to guarantee a space at the end... sorry about that)
